## Secure End-to-End Real-time Communication â€” Source Code:
**Jan 2025 - Feb 2025**
- Utilized: JavaScript, Express, Node.js, Socket.io
- Developed a WebRTC-based real-time chat and video platform, with a Node.js and Socket.io signaling server to facilitate room-based connections and Offer/Answer exchange, with sub-500 ms latency.
- Designed a high-performance React.js frontend with reusable components, React-Router for navigation, and WebSocket integration for seamless real-time interactions.
- Optimized real-time data synchronization using React hooks and WebSocket context provider, reducing latency by 25%.
